      Number of reads classified according to edition types.
      Reads are classified between WT (without an edit), template based modifications and indels.
      Indels are divided between deletions, insertions and delins (deletion + insertion).
      Deletions and insertions can be out of frame or in frame

    description: |
      Number of reads classified between WT and containing indels.
      Both types are classified between passing the filtering steps or not.
      Indel reads passing the filtering steps are divided input:
        reads with a modification above the error rate and located in the common edit window;
        above the error rate but not in the edit region;
        below the error rate and within the edit region;
